This is a test for how nextjs and contentlayer works together to bring out the best of the two content generating kings.

**Happy new year!** What better way to start 2023 than to celebrate the work the Developer Experience teams accomplished in 2022:

Rich has laid the groundwork for many future product docs improvements,
including my favorite which is the framework-aware code blocks and content sections in the docs.
With this, we'll be able to make strides towards customers having a preferred framework selected and remembered across Vercel, so the docs are always in the context of your favorite framework syntax.
Well done!

- I plan to introduce this
- I want to make it work
